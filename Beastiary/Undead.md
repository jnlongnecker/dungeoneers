# Undead

Undead `creatures` are living things that have died once and been reanimated by arca. The type of `undead` depends largely upon context, technique, and the spell that was cast and as such there exist a massive variety of species. `Undead` range from common fodder for novice dungeoneers to some of the most powerful beings to roam Adamah.
