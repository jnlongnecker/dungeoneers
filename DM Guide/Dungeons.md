## What is Known About Dungeons?

The human races have come to pool their accumulated knowledge on these structures, most of which is taught to fledgling dungeoneers while they are at academy. Dungeons are a tool of Devils that have shared characteristics:

1. They contain unusually high densities of demonic arca.
2. They are underneath the surface of Adamah.
3. Fiends spontaneously appear from them.
4. The further down you go, the greater the concentration of demonic arca.
5. The further down you go, the more powerful fiends that appear.

The purpose of them that has been gathered is that they seem to be some hybrid of storage facility, armory, or research facility of varying amounts. Written texts do appear and linguists work towards fully translating the language there, named Abyssal after the plane where it was thought to originate. There is some pushback from the temples that this abyssal knowledge should be destroyed, deciding it to be evil and capable of corrupting individuals that learn it. They do acknowledge the utility of understanding the language, and as a result priests have taken over the learning and translation of Abyssal.

Aside from this, the mechanics of how dungeons work, how they got there and the _why_ behind these concepts are not well understood. Scholars hope that through their combined efforts with the dungeoneers they will eventually uncover these secrets lost to time.
