## The Warring Era

There is little that is understood about the Warring Era. It predates writing, and oral traditions of the time have largely been lost or obfuscated into myth. It is understood that there was considerable war and struggle, and from the smoke and ashes of the age rose early civilization and metallurgy.

## City States

The result of the Warring Era was large separation of humans into cities acting as individual sovereign states. As societies began working together, developments in technology fueled by teams of channelers and sorcerers quickly began to emerge in the form of sophisticated metallurgy.

As people began to organize, regional religions began to formalize and standardize in individual city states. Eventually, the city states began trading, socializing, and especially fighting with one another. The end stages of this era marked the rise of city states of immense military force extending their reach to other city states, creating nascent empires. As these empires grew in size and dwindle in number, the rise of the Sorcerer Kings was at hand.

## Age of Sorcerer Kings

The dominating force out of the City States period were undeniably the Sorcerer Kings; individuals of great influence and power that rose to prominence due to their sorcery. In the majority of cases, the sorcery was hereditary. This generational learning of skill and understanding of sorcery is agreed to be the originator of the prominence of the Sorcerer Kings in the first place, and when it came for heirs to the throne those heirs who displayed greatest prowess with the family sorcery were the ones chosen.

Whatever budding religions that formed in the age of City States was quickly replaced with the self-proclaimed divine providence of the Sorcerer Kings. The family in charge of the empire was the only divinity accepted for worship, and often times individual members of the royal family would oversee domains of worship such as fertility, war, and the ocean.

These Sorcerer Kings were by no means satisfied with their domains; each one plagued with grand ambitions for more land and more conquest. The result was devastating and constant wars on multiple fronts, obsessed with proving the superiority of the family in charge.

The endless clashing of highly powerful individuals yielded 3 major consequences:

1. Families which displayed proficiency in sorcery became part of the nobility and by extension were significant military figures. Families that proved threatening to the established Sorcerer King were often framed for treason or corruption and decimated, as the few occasions where this practice did not occur led to the usurping of power and establishment of a new Sorcerer King.
2. Channeling saw new heights of proficiency in the wartime. The establishment of nobility was primarily through sorcery, but skilled channelers saw an improvement in stance as high or higher than that of sorcerous families. Despite the importance of family, skill with channeling was the most prominent form of meritocracy in Sorcerer King societies.

The third and final consequence was the invention of incantation and the formalization of spellcraft. One of the primary advantages of sorcery over channeling is the difference in outcome for arcana. In the attempt to give the power of sorcery to all combatants, research into spellcraft and the discovery of incantation came out of desperate, beaten empires. Many attempts proved to be failures, and from the ashes of several failures the conquering force of the Sorcerer King Daxtus collected the remnant knowledge and finalized the process for themselves.

The result was overwhelming victory and the establishment of a grand Daxtus empire. However, this empire was not long for this world. Without the grand differential in power between the family of the Sorcerer King and the rank-and-file, a populace revolution overthrew the last and greatest of the Sorcerer Kings.
