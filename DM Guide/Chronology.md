## The Warring Era

There is little that is understood about the Warring Era. It predates writing, and oral traditions of the time have largely been lost or obfuscated into myth. It is understood that there was considerable war and struggle, and from the smoke and ashes of the age rose early civilization and metallurgy.

## City States

The result of the Warring Era was large separation of humans into cities acting as individual sovereign states. As societies began working together, developments in technology fueled by teams of channelers and sorcerers quickly began to emerge in the form of sophisticated metallurgy.

As people began to organize, regional religions began to formalize and standardize in individual city states. Eventually, the city states began trading, socializing, and especially fighting with one another. The end stages of this era marked the rise of city states of immense military force extending their reach to other city states, creating nascent empires. As these empires grew in size and dwindle in number, the rise of the Sorcerer Kings was at hand.
