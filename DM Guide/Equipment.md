## Why Bows?

In the world of Dungeoneers, the society is certainly advanced enough to be capable of creating firearms. And not even the bad ones like the blunderbuss or flintlock; real sophisticated firearms are well within the technological capability of the residents. So why have they not arisen?

Firstly, the omnipresent threat of demons and monsters has created unity amongst humanity. Instead of turning on each other as they did in the distant past, the threat has largely united them to at least not attempt to fight each other. Therefore, the battlefield was primarily in dungeons and not out in the open. This environment is key to the technological advancements made from warfare.

The environment of the dungeons is well-enclosed, typically restrictive underground spaces. Range certainly has its advantages, but the tighter environment limits just how much range is actually necessary. Being able to shoot across hundreds of yards of distance is simply not useful as you'll be hard pressed to find many such distances within the dungeons.

This environment also has the effect of amplifying noise. Sound waves reverberate off of the enclosed walls, making anything that generates a loud noise potentially harmful to the wielder as well as the target. Even flintlock weaponry is capable of breaking the sound barrier, which causes a sonic boom _in addition to_ the explosion from the bullet propellant. The sound generated from firearms is too damaging to the user for it to be practically used in a dungeon.

Since this was the primary environment for combat, developments in weaponry prioritized that which is useful in dungeons above other environments. Over time, bows and crossbows advanced in place of advancements to firearms and reached a point where primitive guns would simply be inferior to bows and crossbows, making the chance they ever get developed essentially zero. After all, it takes time to develop from a simple flintlock to subsonic ammunition with suppressors; time that was better spent developing and improving the already quiet bow.
