# Arcana

In the world of Dungeoneers, arcana is the manipulation of the energy form known as arca. Individuals who are heavy practitioners of arcana are known as arcanists. To an arcanist, one of the greatest insults one can make is calling their arcana "magic". To the humans of Adamah, magic is the same as it is in our world: mundane illusions and sleight of hand. Arcana is real manipulation of energy, not a parlor trick.

There are several different unique types of arcana, each with their own unique results and techniques of activation. Arcanism, the study of arcana, is still a fledgling science but the advent of dungeon opening has greatly improved the collective knowledge of arcana for humanity.

## Arca

Arca is a potent and omnipresent energy source on Adamah. As an individual moves up or down in elevation, arca becomes gradually more and more abundant than at sea level elevation. In dungeons, the presence of arca is greatly increased. They are the locations with the most abundant arca bar none, making experimentation with arcana easier within their depths.

Arca is primarily found ambient in the world; the mechanism that produces it currently is unknown. It can also be produced by creatures who have practiced channeling arca through their bodies to create arcana. The degree of arca that a creature can create and control may increase through training in places with high concentrations of arca; a mechanism still not fully understood.

Types of arca can be distinguished with enough training or sensitivity, but all arca seems to be equally effective at performing arcana. Demonic arca is found underground and in dungeons, while holy arca is found at mountain peaks. Fae arca is found leaking through Faerealm rifts and around fae forests. The miniscule ambient arca at the surface of Adamah and the arca produced by creatures is simply referred to as "arca". The type of arca seems to be important to creatures made primarily of the arca of their native plane, like fae creatures, as they seem to be unable to survive extended periods of time outside of concentrations of their corresponding arca. In fact, much of what is understood about types of arca is an extrapolation of what is known about how fae arca interacts with fae creatures.

A thread common to all arcana is that an increase in the arca used for the arcana equates to an increase in the potency of the arcana. The way this "potency" manifests depends on the arcana in question; for example arcana that harms a creature will be more lethal with more arca or arcana that lasts a certain duration will last longer based on the arca used.

### Crystals and Arca

Arca is notably difficult to gather and channel into arcana. Through years of study, the elves eventually uncovered the impact that crystals have on arca and how to utilize this impact for arcana. A crystal used to aid in the casting of arcana is called a focus and utilizing one requires specialized training. With precise arca control and practice, one can utilize the crystalline system of the crystal in order to guide the arca into higher concentrations in less time and effort than otherwise. There are 7 different crystalline systems that interact with different elements:

1. Monoclinic - Fire elemental (Ex: Brazilianite, Gypsum, Azurite)
2. Rhombic - Water elemental (Ex: Topaz, Olivine, Aragonite)
3. Cubic - Fire and Water elemental (Ex: Diamond, Pyrite, Sphalerite)
4. Tetragonal - Loam elemental (Ex: Scheelite, Wulfenite, Zircon)
5. Trigonal - Wind elemental (Ex: Corundum, Dolomite, Tourmaline)
6. Hexagonal - Wind and Loam elemental (Ex: Vanadinite, Nephelite, Beryl)
7. Triclinic - Aether elemental (Ex: Labradorite, Microcline, Wollastonite)

Sorcerers and creatures that can perform sorcery are known to have high amounts of crystalline structures in their bodies with a system corresponding to the type of sorcery they can utilize. The crystalline systems listed are in order of how many types of crystal exist that posses that crystalline system.

Where crystal systems become extremely important is in enchantments. Without an arcanist there to guide or gather arca properly, crystals take their place and provide the necessary arca. When enchanting an object, the type of enchantment should be known ahead of time in order to prepare the proper crystal for the enchantment.

## Spellcraft

The most well-understood and practiced form of arcana is spellcraft. All humans have the capacity for spellcraft, but often times must undergo extensive training to gain the arca capacity to actually cast spells. Spellcraft is arcana that utilizes inscription circles and incantations in order to produce a well-defined and known result, called a spell.

There are two schools of spellcraft; the school of inscription which focuses on study and creation of spells and the school of incantation, which focuses on the mastery of casting spells. For an individual to be experienced in both schools is virtually unheard of and reserved for geniuses of typically the most long-lived species of humans. Between the two, the school of incantation is by far the largest due to it being far more approachable and realistic for someone to gain achievement in.

An arcanist of the school of incantation, sometimes referred to as an incanter but typically as just an arcanist, utilizes spells that they have learned in practical real world scenarios. Doing so requires them to have memorized both the incantation of the spell and how to inscribe its inscription circle. Once both are in place, the true skill of an incanter is realized as they channel the necessary arca through the circle while reciting the incantation. The power of a spell depends on the amount of arca the caster is able to channel while performing the incantation.

Incantations are recursive; meaning they can be recited as many times as desired without releasing a spell in order to build up more arca. Once the desired arca has been channeled into the spell, the caster releases the spell by finishing the incantation and releasing the built up arca. The inscription circle is far and away the most complex piece to a spell and needs to be incredibly precise in order to avoid corrupting the spell and either losing power, losing the spell entirely, or having the spell backfire and harm the caster. Due to this, it takes a very long time to properly inscribe an inscription circle alongside any necessary channeling circles for particularly complex spells. Incanters therefore use pre-written inscription circles in tools called tomes; books that contain the inscription circle of a single spell and the necessary channeling circles for its use on separate pages.

An arcanist of the school of inscription, often referred to as a scribe, typically does not cast spells but instead experiments with their creation. A scribe must have some capacity to cast spells, but as inscription is largely collaborative the scribe will be able to have the aid of incanters or other scribes in order to test out new spells they may not be able to cast themselves. Spell inscriptions are broken into 4 parts:

1. The characters used
2. The arrangement of characters within a circle
3. The number and order of circles
4. The number of channeling circles

If any of the above is incorrect by even the slightest of margins, the spell risks complete failure to do anything at all. The only exception is that there may be more channeling circles than what is necessary, but not less. Most of a scribes time is not spent creating new spells; it is instead in creating tomes for incanters to use. While many incanters are capable of producing correct inscription circles, most do not bother to learn the inscription circles for every spell they would like to use as this would take a considerable amount of time and practice. They instead learn the inscription circles for rare and powerful spells that are too complex to fit into tomes.

### Channeling

Channeling is the practice of molding arca into a raw output of energy. An arcanist that specializes in the school of channeling, often referred to as a channeler or (especially in the case of channeling warriors) an arcaknight, does not use their arca for spells. Most channeling is performed by arcaknights, who channel arca in order to improve their durability and prowess. These warriors also will channel arca in order to enhance their physical strikes with raw elemental power with the assistance of a focus, creating devastating effects such as a flaming blade or a wind strike that extends out dozens of feet.

Channeling is closely tied with the "mind-muscle connection" phenomenon; but requires not only for the mind to connect with the body but also the very spirit of the being. Once connection to the muscle is established through training, the essence of channeling is to extend the very sense of self into that part of the body. Through practice, this results in the energy of arca to be used to enhance physical capabilities. The natural progression is to add the "color" of an element onto the arca and to release that built up arca into the world to affect it.

Channeling as a form of arcana is less precise in outcome than spellcraft due to its unstructured nature, but the benefit is that it doesn't require the cumbersome management of tomes in order to utilize. Due to spellcraft and channeling being near polar opposites as well as the physical training necessary to perfect it, channelers and incanters are rarely the same person.

### Cantrips

A cantrip is the name of spell which have the following two properties for an arcanist:

1. They have practiced the spell to complete mastery with no arca waste
2. They have inscribed permanently on their person, typically in the form of a conventional ink tattoo

Therefore, any spell can technically become a cantrip for an individual arcanist, but it is rare for anything but simple spells to become cantrips for an arcanist. The most common spell to become a cantrip is the Requipment spell, which is a requirement for anyone who wishes to become a dungeoneer. An arcanist is often measured by the number of cantrips they have acquired so it is common for their cantrips to be on exposed parts of their skin.

If an arcanist has not practiced the spell to the necessary point and still get the inscription circle permanently inscribed on themselves anyways, the circle will constantly siphon off their arca in an attempt to activate and potentially leave the individual crippled and unable to use arca ever again. It is common practice to get a temporary tattoo first in order to ensure the arcanist can truly handle the spells inscription circle.

## Sorcery

Sorcery is arcana that is performed without any guidance whatsoever. Due to this fact, a creature capable of more than 1 kind of sorcery is extremely rare. Sorcery is extremely instinctual and personalized to the individual, but the result of sorcery can always be replicated by a spell. It's theorized that sorcery is simply a far more advanced form of spellcraft that needs no inscription circle or incantation.

Humans capable of sorcery are called sorcerers and will often times become arcanists who use their sorcery in supplement of their normal spellcraft. In the past when arcana duels were more common, the best duelists were often sorcerers who would utilize their sorcery to surprise their opponents with a spell they couldn't predict. From those days, it has become standard practice for sorcerers to hide their sorcery from most people, but in recent times a growing number of sorcerous youths instead choose to flaunt it for the awe factor and to potentially aid them in being accepted into dungeoneering academies.

## Miracles and Curses

Miracles and curses are two sides of what is essentially the same arcana, given different names by how their effects are realized in the world. Either of these arcana are arcana performed by calling upon another entity to cast while using the caster as a channel for the arcana. A miracle affects positively while a curse affects negatively.

Miracles and curses can only be performed when an individual has a strong connection with a being powerful enough to perform a miracle or a curse, most commonly deities and spirits of great power. It's not understood what is required of the other party as humans have only ever been able to channel a miracle or curse and not be the originator of its casting.

What is understood about miracles and curses is that the caster must invoke the request of the miracle or curse, typically called a prayer or a chant. Through communion and devotion with the greater being, a caster learns which miracles and curses they are given permission to perform and how often, as acting as the channel takes a toll on the caster unlike that of typical arcana.

Humans who have invoked miracles and curses report that the feeling is that of their very spirit risking collapse as they invoke more and more without rest. Taking time to recuperate seems necessary in order to repair the strain of being a channel for this type of arcana. While this strain has never been lethal, some greater sense of self-preservation prevents casters from using miracles or curses that would cause irreparable damage or death to the caster.

## Enchantment

Enchantment is a recent development in arcanism, a field reverse-engineered from discoveries in dungeons. Enchantment is arcana that is imbued into objects; non-living things. The process is difficult and requires mastery in several different disciplines depending on what object is to be enchanted.

First, the desired arcana must be formalized as a spell via spellcraft. This immediately rules out miracles and curses from human derived enchantment as it is unknown how to formalize miracles and curses as spells. This is not to say it is impossible to enchant something with the effect of a miracle or curse because items enchanted with both have been found within dungeons; it is just currently unknown.

Next, the proper crystal must be sourced in order to properly channel arca to the enchantment. The crystal rarely remains intact through the process, it is more common for it to be crushed and spread throughout the material used to create the object. However, more powerful enchantments require the crystal to be embedded in the item in some way. The obvious next step is to of course create the object desired to be enchanted. This is done in a similar way as normal, with the crystal somehow worked into the material or the design.

Once the object has been created, arcanists called enchanters must inscribe the inscription circle on the object. In some cases, this is the final step. In these instances, the enchanted object will require an incantation in order to activate. This can be circumvented by duplicating the inscription circle in a way where they are parallel to one another and then performing the incantation. The inscription circle will perpetually be active with no intervention necessary by the user. Enchantments of the former are invoked enchantments, the latter perpetual enchantments.

Particularly powerful enchantments or enchantments done with insufficient quantities of the correct crystal will require arca drawn from the user. This is sometimes done intentionally in perpetual enchantments if the user is intended to be an individual with arca capacity in order to have better control over when the enchantment is active while still not requiring an incantation. When done intentionally, these are called activated enchantments. Otherwise, they are just referred to as a poorly executed enchantment.

## Pact

A pact is much more than a contract, it is arcana that will activate automatically in response to certain actions that are lain out in the pact. In order for a pact to be formed, two or more parties must consent to the terms in the pact and be capable of offering what it is they are required to by casting that arcana into the pact. The actions lain out can only be actions taken by those within the pact; so it cannot be something that requires another individual. When the pact activates, it draws arca from all parties involved and the arcana specified is cast. Due to this fact, pacts that activate regularly are much less common or are made with beings of supreme power like archfaeries.

Blank pacts are created from the Make Pact spell which was discovered by accident from research into miracles and curses. This spell is highly guarded as it has been abused in the past to cripple arcanists that enter into predatory pacts. Instead, a lesser variant known as a summoning pact is used. A summoning pact makes a single stipulation: the summoned party will send a fragment of their spirit when summoned to the summoner. Of course, only certain creatures are capable of such a feat. Those that can are special creatures called familiars that are capable of sorcery that detaches and controls their spirit.

## Limits of Arcana

Arcana that inflicts harm using the elements, reshapes local terrain, causes explosions, enhances physical abilities, provides protection and stress recovery are all fairly standard and common. Illusions, flight, wound recovery and mind influence are uncommon arcana and reserved for arcanists of intermediate skill. Invisibility, necromancy, revival and teleportation are all rare and very difficult arcana to perform.

Wound recovery has been known about for some time, but remains in the realm of miracles. Current spellcraft knowledge does not yet know how to produce spell effects that heal physical wounds. It's common for even novice miracle invokers to be able to use wound healing miracles, but the amount of times they are able to do so is often rather restricted.

Necromancy involves tying a spirit to a corpse in order to reanimate once-living creatures. The origin of this kind of arcana is actually well known to be from the deity Mot who originally developed it to create armies to spread death. In modern times, necromancy is typically either outlawed or highly regulated. Where it is legal, there is extensive paperwork and enchanted contracts in place in order to ensure that both the body and spirit used consent to the process and can release themselves from the spell. Certain individuals of intense loyalty will occasionally volunteer themselves to be eternal servants as undead; it is for these individuals that the practice is maintained.

Revival magic restores a spirit to its body after the body has been damaged to the point of the spirit detaching. Doing so requires the caster to first restore the body to a state that can contain the spirit again, which sits firmly in the realm of miracles. They then detach their own spirit in order to find the specific spirit in question; another task only possible through miracles. Once found, the caster uses their tether to their body to guide both themselves and the spirit to the proper bodies. This is the only known way of interplanar travel; as soon as the spirit is detached it is innately able to travel to the spiritual plane where spirits congregate after death. Dungeoneers will often have sponsors whose job is to wait in the spiritual plane for the spirit of the dungeoneer so they can be brought back once their body is retrieved and restored in exchange for a cut of the spoils.

Teleportation is a new form of arcana only discovered from dungeons. Currently, the only way to teleport is in a location with very high concentrations of arca that also has the proper inscription circle inscribed, and this can only take you somewhere with a corresponding inscription circle. Since there are not locations on the surface of Adamah with the necessary concentrations of arca, it is prohibitively difficult to use teleportation in any way other than teleporting out of a dungeon. Teleporting from the surface would require a team of 10 or more of some of the most skilled arcanists in the world, but teleporting out of a dungeon simply requires a single arcanist trained in teleportation.
