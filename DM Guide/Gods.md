# Dieties and Mythological Figures

Adamah and the planes around it are home to many creatures of unfathomable power classified as gods and demigods. These supreme beings are the driving force behind the creation of the lesser creatures in the multiverse and many of their motivations. While these creatures are unbelievably powerful, none of them are all-knowing or all-powerful, and all are susceptible to death in their own ways.

The dieties and greater mythological figures can mostly be grouped together in loose alliances or categories. While not all are worshiped (some may even be taboo in many cultures), all are revered for their power alone and the invocation of their names bear an ounce of the power they hold.

## Elementals

The natural elements of magica (fire, water, loam, wind and aether) have embodiments in the form of the Elementals. It's fairly common for members of the Elementals to be worshipped in any society, and again common for these beings to be at the head of most pantheons. The Elementals are responsible for the creation of the multiverse Lel; most planes are of their creation (but not all) and they are the driving force for the rules that govern Lel.

### Al, the Timefather

Al represents the element of aether; of spacetime.

### Hedamu, the Wavecrasher

Hedamu represents the element of water.

### Hadad, the Groundshaker

Hadad represents the element of loam.

### Anat, the War Queen

Anat represents the element of wind.

### Shapash, the Lawbrand

Shapash represents the element of fire.

## Pandora

Many planes in Lel had living flora and fauna appear from the condensation of magica. The single plane that stands as an exception is the plane of Gaia, where the magica condensed instead into the diety Pandora. Pandora was the lone being to inhabit Gaia, which she quickly decided was a waste of the plane. She became the first diety to perform intentional creation of mortal beings, starting with flora and eventually branching into fauna. The work of Gaia became extremely diverse as she imbued her creations to create life of their own and propagate themselves in their own worlds, and over time she allowed this process to run its course. Occasionally she would intervene if catastrophe was inevitable, but eventually the system became stable.

Late into the lifespan of Gaia, the Elohim arrived and became interested in the creations of Pandora. At this point, Pandora had grown tired of her experiment and wished to move on. In a joint agreement with the Elohim, her divinity was shattered and imbued into her creation with mixed results. Those that took to it well were classified as humanity, while those that did not were classified as plants and beasts. Some plants and beasts simply took time to accommodate their shard of divinity to eventually join humanity. This shard of divinity allows humans to grow and acclimate to magica; something that was not possible. Beasts and plants became sensitive to magica for the first time with their shard, but they could not control it in the way the humans could.

Since Pandora never existed at the same time as humanity could worship her and since she no longer existed to be worshipped, she does not have any kind of clergy devoted to her. However, she is highly revered amongst humans; her most devoted followers taking it upon themselves to become the new stewards of beasts and plants.

## The Elohim

The patron dieties to humanity convene as the Elohim. While they are grouped together, they do not all get along with one another. Their categorization is purely the fact that they are the creators and patrons to the human species. While not _all_ humans worship (or even worship one of the Elohim), they are well and widely known amongst humanity. In the vast majority of human societies, worship outside of the Elohim is met with apprehension or even violence.

The Elohim inhabit the plane of Elysia which lies above Adamah. The magica that leaks from Elysia is stained with the holy essence of the Alohim, transforming those with extended contact with it. This magica serves as the lifeblood to the Alohim and they are unable to exist for extended periods of time outside of Elysia.

### Baal

### Asherah

### Kothar

### Beruth

### Hauron

### Resheph

## Devils

As Al shaped the planes, each plane was imbued with magica. The magica of the Abyss became home to the group of dieties known as Devils. Over time, the clashing of magica from the Abyss with that from Alysia formed the central plane of Adamah; the plane most devoid of magica. The Alohim created humanity and with them conquered Adamah which invoked the ire of Devils who sought to do the same. Thus launched the ageless conflict between Alohim and Devils and (by proxy) demons and humans.

Devils shaped themselves out of the abundance of magica found in the Abyss, a pattern that continues in their demon subordinates. Early on, a hierarchy was established out of the disparity of power between them which has only shifted a handful of times due to Devils not being able to gain or lose power in themselves and must turn to artifacts to improve their power.

### Belial

### Behemoth

### Beelzebub

### Asmodeus

### Satanas

### Lucifer

## Archfaeries

Faeries are a diverse group of beings that all come from more common forms of fae beings once they attain a certain amount of power. In societal terms, the faeries are the elites of fae society. Archfaeries are faeries that have attained such a high degree of power that they have more in common with dieties than they do with even the powerful faerie elites they once were. These fae gods rule over their subordinates in a much more direct way than typical dieties as leaders in councils, but not all archfaeries sit at that position of power. There are many that have been sealed away or exiled in disgrace; or are generally unknown and live as hermits in quiet peace within the Faerealm.

Unlike the pantheons of humans and demons, the fae do not have a singular widely known pantheon as maintenance (and development) of the Faerealm is handed down or assigned to archfaeries in an ever-changing process determined by the Archcouncil. There are 3 archfaeries that act as members of the Archcouncil and make the final decision of where to delegate responsibility of maintaining the Faerealm and are the 3 faeries that came into being alongside the Faerealm.

### Orion

Orion is hotblooded and radical; constantly seeking change and improvement. He searches endlessly for improvements to efficiency, especially in time improvements. If something hasn't undergone a change recently, he sinks his teeth into it and attempts to overhaul it. As a result, he tends to hyper-focus on individual pieces and looks at the micro picture.

### Tatiana

Tatiana looks at much more of a macro picture, loosing many of the details in the process. She sees smaller changes as potentially compromising to the overarching whole and fears at the wide-reaching implications of radical changes to many things at once. As a result, she is far more hesitant for change on the micro level and instead prefers small changes at the macro level if any changes at all.

### Xerix

Xerix serves as the foil to the constant malleability of Orion and the stubborn inflexibility of Tatiana and attempts to mediate between the two. It is understood by the council that Orion and Tatiana cannot agree on most if not all things, and instead the way things work is that these two will present their case to Xerix and they will instead mediate towards a most convenient middle ground. Xerix is quite good at doing this, however as a result they are not very capable of identifying and considering changes that ought to be made with little to no outside input. Therefore, the actual ideas of change do not come from them directly; instead rising as a result from the aforementioned mediation. Xerix is given the final say of the council.

## Mot

Mot stands alone; not as part of a group but as a singular destructive force. Mot has the potential to destroy all things in Lel, including Lel itself. However, Mot is intelligent enough to realize that should it do this, there will be nothing left to destroy. As such, Mot has no interest in truly destroying everything that is and instead will patiently wait until the proper time to destroy.

Few beings have the capability to subdue Mot; many dieties were destroyed before the creation of mortal beings like humans. Initially created as a way to satiate Mot, these mortals became useful for other purposes such as the proxy war between Elohim and Devils.

Mot holds dominion over death itself; death of any kind in fact. As such, Mot is the singular being that simply cannot be killed as a fundamental rule of the multiverse. It can be subdued, beaten back, and sealed for a time but can never be fully restrained.

Mot is inscrutable and unusual; it has been known to favor certain mortals who it believes will net positive in destruction and even suspend their deaths for the time being. As such, there are many cults dedicated to Mot, especially amongst those that believe something to be corrupt and in need of "drastic cleansing" through death.

From Mot comes the knowledge to create beings of undeath. Originally created by Mot to serve as its minions, the ways to develop undead and the various types of undead have evolved over the millennia that undead have existed. Some mortals even seek to bind undead to their whims or turn themselves into undead beings through various esoteric rituals. Unknown to these mortals is that doing so binds them forever to Mots will who can, at a whim, turn them into obedient thralls with no will of their own. Of course, Mot will seldom do as such, especially because those who stoop to such tactics inherently perform the destruction Mot seeks.
