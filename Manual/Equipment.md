# Equipment

Listed here are `items` that may confer a number of benefits to the `creature` that `equips` them. All `equipment` **must** be `equipped` in order to provide any benefit or penalty to the `creature` using the `equipment`. Something to note here is that an `item` being `equipped` is distinct from an `item` being held, carried or donned. `Creatures` may hold or don `items` when it is reasonable that they can, but they acquire none of the benefits (or penalties) from that `item`.

> For example, Suori has a glaive and a dagger. In order to properly `equip` the glaive, she must use 2 `wield` slots. In layman terms, she needs both hands to properly use her glaive. This does **not** mean she always has to occupy both of her hands with the glaive, however. Only when she wishes to properly `equip` the glaive does she need to do so with both `wield` slots. This means it is perfectly fine for her to hold the glaive in one hand, and `equip` her dagger to make an `attack`. Since her glaive is not properly `equipped`, it confers no benefit to Suori while she makes her `attack` with the dagger.

## Weapons

A weapon is an `item` that is used to make `strikes`. Each weapon has a certain range by which it can make a `strike` against something, as well as a class that is used for `masteries`. It would be impossible to list out all of the weapons that exist in the world; instead weapons are divided into 6 `weapon types`: Improvised, Light, Standard, Control, Heavy, and Missile. Some examples of each `weapon type` are provided, but they are by no means an exhaustive list. Work with your GM to flavor your weapon in the way you wish.

### Weapon Types

**Improvised**

-   _Range:_ Reach
-   _Class:_ None
-   _Wounds:_ 1 Physical
-   _Properties:_ `Toss`
-   _Wield Slots:_ 1

> Examples: a fist, a kick, a broken wine bottle, an improperly equipped weapon, a rock, a headbutt, a shovel.

Any object capable of causing harm when wielded using a single hand is applicable as an Improvised weapon. If it requires two hands, it is too unwieldy to be used as an Improvised weapon.

**Light**

-   _Range:_ Reach
-   _Class:_ Blade, Cudgel, Axe, Lance
-   _Wounds:_ 1 Physical
-   _Properties:_ `Toss`
-   _Wield Slots:_ 1

> Examples: a dagger, a handaxe, a light hammer, a javelin

**Standard**

-   _Range:_ Reach
-   _Class:_ Blade, Cudgel, Axe, Lance
-   _Wounds:_ 2 Physical
-   _Properties:_ None
-   _Wield Slots:_ 1

> Examples: a broadsword, a battleaxe, a maul, a spear

**Control**

-   _Range:_ Reach + 1
-   _Class:_ Blade, Cudgel, Axe, Lance
-   _Wounds:_ 2 Physical
-   _Properties:_ None
-   _Wield Slots:_ 2

> Examples: a zweihander, a bardiche, a polehammer, a partisan

**Heavy**

-   _Range:_ Reach
-   _Class:_ Blade, Cudgel, Axe, Lance
-   _Wounds:_ 3 Physical
-   _Properties:_ None
-   _Wield Slots:_ 2

> Examples: a longsword, a broadaxe, a lever mace, a glaive

**Missile**

-   _Range:_ 10
-   _Class:_ Missile
-   _Wounds:_ 1 Physical
-   _Properties:_ None
-   _Wield Slots:_ 2

> Examples: a sling, a crossbow, a longbow

## Tomes

A tome is an `item` that must be `equipped` in order to cast `spells` quickly. The tome itself contains a single `spell` written in it, while the rest of the pages are focusing circles to charge `arca` for the `spell`. There isn't any functional difference between mundane tomes, but a mage will likely posses multiple tomes on their person to be able to cast different `spells`. Unless otherwise specified, a tome must be `equipped` in a `wield` `equipment slot`.

## Foci

A `focus` is an `item` that must be `equipped` to improve `spell` power. Enchanted `foci` do different things than mundane ones, and mundane `foci` are all the same in effect, but different `spells` react better to different `foci`. Unless otherwise specified, a `focus` must be `equipped` in a `wield` `equipment slot`.

## Armor

Armor is `equipped` by a `creature` in order to increase their `armor points`. There are 4 categories of armor: clothing, light, medium, and heavy. Each piece of armor has an `equipment slot`, a benefit, a category and properties to describe additional restrictions or bonuses. Like weapons, there are too many pieces of armor to list out. Instead, they are organized into their categories.

**Clothing**

-   _Slots:_ Body, Hand, Feet, Head, Belt, Back, Hang
-   _Armor Points:_ --
-   _Properties:_ None

> Examples: a robe, silk gloves, leather belt, a scarf, a knit hat, shoes

**Light Armor**

-   _Slots:_ Body, Hand, Feet, Head
-   _Armor Points:_ 1
-   _Properties:_ None

> Examples: studded leather body armor, boiled leather gloves, boiled leather boots, padded leather helm

**Medium Armor**

-   _Slots:_ Body, Hand, Feet, Head
-   _Armor Points:_ 2
-   _Properties:_ `Body(4)`

> Examples: brigandine armor, chain gloves, reinforced boots, zischagge

**Heavy Armor**

-   _Slots:_ Body, Hand, Feet, Head
-   _Armor Points:_ 3
-   _Properties:_ `Body(5)`

> Examples: plate mail armor, plated gauntlets, plated greaves, great helm

## Shields

Shields similarly come in different categories: light, medium, and heavy. Shields have the same stats as their armor counterparts, except they use one `wield` `equipment slot`.

**Light Shield**

-   _Slots:_ Wield
-   _Armor Points:_ 1
-   _Properties:_ None

> Examples: a buckler

**Medium Shield**

-   _Slots:_ Wield
-   _Armor Points:_ 2
-   _Properties:_ `Body(4)`

> Examples: a kite shield

**Heavy Shield**

-   _Slots:_ Wield
-   _Armor Points:_ 3
-   _Properties:_ `Body(5)`

> Examples: a tower shield

### Armor Points

The purpose of armor is protection from `wounds`; the amount of protection is represented by `armor points`. Equipped armor grants `armor points` as indicated on the armor table. `Armor points` allow you to take more `wounds` than normal. Whenever you would sustain a `wound` while you have `armor points` remaining, you instead subtract the number of `wounds` you would sustain from your remaining `armor points`. If you would sustain more `wounds` than you have `armor points`, you sustain the leftover `wounds` as normal.

Once `armor points` are depleted, they must be repaired to come back.

## Properties

`Properties` are given to `items` to apply `modifications`, either to the `item` itself to give requirements for its use or `effects` that apply to the `creature` using the `item`. For `items` that can be `equipped`, they _must_ be `equipped` in order for any `property` that affects the `creature` to apply.

### Toss

A weapon with the `toss` `property` additionally can be thrown, gaining a range equal to twice the `creatures` `body` score. When doing so, the weapon is no longer `equipped` when the `strike` is resolved. If the `striking` roll does not succeed, the weapon ends up within 2 tiles of the target location.

### Body

An `item` with the `body(x)` `property` requires the `creature` that wishes to `equip` it to have a `body` score of x or above. If a `creature` does not meet this requirement and still `equips` the `item`, calculate the difference between x and the `creature's` `body` score. That `creature` gains that many points of `bane` to _all rolls_. If multiple `equipped` `items` have this `property`, the one with the highest x is used.

> For example, Ulfarmi has a `body` score of 1. If he `equips` an `item` with the `body(3)` `property`, he suffers 2 points of `bane` on every single roll he does; rolls to `hit`, `skill` rolls... everything! Be careful what you wear!
