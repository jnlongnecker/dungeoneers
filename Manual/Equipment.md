# Equipment

Listed here are `items` that may confer a number of benefits to the `creature` that `equips` them. All `equipment` **must** be `equipped` in order to provide any benefit or penalty to the `creature` using the `equipment`. Something to note here is that an `item` being `equipped` is distinct from an `item` being held, carried or donned. `Creatures` may hold or don `items` when it is reasonable that they can, but they acquire none of the benefits (or penalties) from that `item`.

> For example, Suori has a glaive and a dagger. In order to properly `equip` the glaive, she must use 2 `wield` slots. In layman terms, she needs both hands to properly use her glaive. This does **not** mean she always has to occupy both of her hands with the glaive, however. Only when she wishes to properly `equip` the glaive does she need to do so with both `wield` slots. This means it is perfectly fine for her to hold the glaive in one hand, and `equip` her dagger to make an `attack`. Since her glaive is not properly `equipped`, it confers no benefit to Suori while she makes her `attack` with the dagger.

## Weapons

A weapon is an `item` that is used to make `attacks`. When a `creature` makes an `attack` `action`, the weapon they wield determines a variety of statistics that are used during the `attack`. A `creature` has `weapon ranks` with certain weapon categories. If a `creature` does not have the proper `weapon rank` for the weapon they are `wielding`, the weapon is instead treated as an improvised weapon. This applies to magical weapons as well as mundane ones. Unless otherwise specified, a weapon must be `equipped` in a `wield` `equipment slot`.

## Tomes

A tome is an `item` that must be `equipped` in order to cast `spells` quickly. The tome itself contains a single `spell` written in it, while the rest of the pages are focusing circles to charge `magica` for the `spell`. There isn't any functional difference between mundane tomes, but a mage will likely posses multiple tomes on their person to be able to cast different `spells`. Unless otherwise specified, a tome must be `equipped` in a `wield` `equipment slot`.

## Foci

A `focus` is an `item` that must be `equipped` to improve `spell` power. Magical `foci` do different things than mundane ones, and mundane `foci` are all the same in effect, but different `spells` react better to different `foci`. Unless otherwise specified, a `focus` must be `equipped` in a `wield` `equipment slot`.

| Focus Name | Property  |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Orb        | Demonic 2 |
| Wand       | Arcane 2  |
| Symbol     | Holy 2    |
| Staff      | Magica 1  |

## Armor

Armor is `equipped` by a `creature` in order to increase their `armor value` and `spell resistance`. There are 4 categories of armor: clothing, light, medium and heavy. Each piece of armor has an `equipment slot`, a benefit, a category and properties to describe additional restrictions or bonuses.

All medium armor has the `power 2` property innately, and all heavy armor has the `power 3` property innately.

| Armor Name     | Category     | Spell Resistance (SR) | Armor Value (AV) | Equipment Slot | Properties  |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- |

## Properties

`Properties` are given to `items` to apply `modifications`, either to the `item` itself to give requirements for its use or `effects` that apply to the `creature` using the `item`. For `items` that can be `equipped`, they _must_ be `equipped` in order for any `property` that affects the `creature` to apply.

### Toss

A weapon with the `toss` `property` can used to make an `attack` against `creatures` a number of tiles equal to the `creatures` `power` score + `threat range` away. When doing so, the weapon is no longer `equipped` when the `attack` is resolved and `moves` to the target location.

### Two-handed

A weapon with the `two-handed` `property` must use 2 `wield` slots instead of 1 in order to be properly `equipped`.

### Threat +

A weapon with the `threat + x` `property` increases the `threat range` of the `creature` by x tiles while `equipped`.

### Ammunition

A weapon with the `ammunition` `property` must be loaded with some sort of weapon ammunition specified in the parenthesis () of the `property`. For example, a weapon with the `ammunition (arrows)` `property` must be loaded with arrows.

### Range

A weapon with the `range` `property` cannot be used to make melee `attacks`. `Attacks` with this weapon must be outside the `creatures` `threat range`, but inside the number of tiles denoted in the `property`.

> For example, the hunting bow has the `range (5)` `property`. This means that for a `creature` with a `threat range` of 1, the hunting bow can be used to make `attacks` to any `creature` 2-5 tiles away.

## Power

An `item` with the `power x` `property` requires the `creature` that wishes to `equip` it to have a `power` score of x or above. If a `creature` does not meet this requirement and still `equips` the `item`, that `creature` suffers a penalty to **all rolls** equal to the difference between x and the `creature's` `power` score. If multiple `equipped` `items` have this `property`, the one with the highest x is used.

> For example, Ulfarmi has a `power` score of 1. If he `equips` an `item` with the `power 3` `property`, he rolls 2 _fewer_ dice on every single roll he does; his `hit dice` rolls, `dodge dice` rolls, `spell pierce` rolls... everything! Be careful what you wear!

### Spellbane

The `spellbane x` `property` afflicts the `creature` with the denoted amount of `spellbane`. For x points of `spellbane`, that `creature` rolls x fewer dice on _all_ rolls as an `attacker` during a `spellcast` `action`. `Spellbane` from multiple sources will stack with itself.

> For example, a `creature` with `spellbane 2` and `spellbane 1` functionally has `spellbane 3`. If that `creature` makes a `spellcast` `action`, their `spell hit` rolls, `spell pierce` rolls and `spell save` rolls are all reduced by **3** dice!

### Spellboon

The `spellboon x` `property` afflicts the `creature` with the denoted amount of `spellboon`. For x points of `spellboon`, that `creature` rolls x additional dice on _all_ rolls as an `attacker` during a `spellcast` `action`. `Spellboon` from multiple sources will stack with itself.

### Demonic

The `demonic x` `property` allows the `creature` to treat all `demonic` `spells` as having x _additional_ `magica` used on it. Note that this additional `magica` cannot cover the base `spell` `magica` cost.

### Arcane

The `arcane x` `property` allows the `creature` to treat all `arcane` `spells` as having x _additional_ `magica` used on it. Note that this additional `magica` cannot cover the base `spell` `magica` cost.

### Holy

The `holy x` `property` allows the `creature` to treat all `holy` `spells` as having x _additional_ `magica` used on it. Note that this additional `magica` cannot cover the base `spell` `magica` cost.

### Magica

The `magica x` `property` allows the `creature` to treat **all** `spells` as having x _additional_ `magica` used on it. Note that this additional `magica` cannot cover the base `spell` `magica` cost.
