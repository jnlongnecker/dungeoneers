# Equipment

Listed here are mundane weapons and armor that `creatures` can utilize during their adventures. Also listed are mundane items that `creatures` may find helpful.

## Weapons

A weapon is an `item` that must be `equipped` in order to have effect. When a `creature` makes an `attack` `action`, the weapon they wield determines a variety of statistics that are used during the `attack`. A `creature` has `weapon ranks` with certain weapon categories. If a `creature` does not have the proper `weapon rank` for the weapon they are `wielding`, the weapon is instead treated as an improvised weapon. This applies to magical weapons as well as mundane ones. Unless otherwise specified, a weapon must be `equipped` in a `hand` `equipment slot`.

## Tomes

A tome is an `item` that must be `equipped` in order to cast `spells` quickly. The tome itself contains a single `spell` written in it, while the rest of the pages are focusing circles to charge `magica` for the `spell`. There isn't any functional difference between mundane tomes, but a mage will likely posses multiple tomes on their person to be able to cast different `spells`. Unless otherwise specified, a tome must be `equipped` in a `hand` `equipment slot`.

## Foci

A `focus` is an `item` that must be `equipped` to improve `spell` power. Magical `foci` do different things than mundane ones, and mundane `foci` are all the same in effect, but different `spells` react better to different `foci`. Unless otherwise specified, a `focus` must be `equipped` in a `hand` `equipment slot`.

| Focus Name | Benefit\* | Target Spell Type |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Orb        | 2         | Demonic           |
| Wand       | 2         | Arcane            |
| Symbol     | 2         | Holy              |
| Staff      | 1         | All               |

\* _The benefit for a `focus` is free `magica` spent for the purpose of `spell pierce` rolls. For example, if an orb is wielded and a demonic `spell` is cast, if 0 `magica` is spent for the `spell pierce` the `creature` would roll 2 `spell pierce` dice._

## Armor

Armor is `equipped` by a `creature` in order to increase their `armor value` and, `spell resistance`. There are 4 categories of armor: clothing, light, medium and heavy. Each piece of armor has an `equipment slot`, a benefit, a category and properties to describe additional restrictions or bonuses.

| Armor Name     | Category     | Spell Resistance (SR) | Armor Value (AV) | Equipment Slot | Properties  |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
