# Equipment

Listed here are mundane weapons and armor that `creatures` can utilize during their adventures. Also listed are mundane items that `creatures` may find helpful.

## Weapons

A weapon is an `item` that must be `wielded` in order to have effect. When a `creature` makes an `attack` `action`, the weapon they `wield` determines a variety of statistics that are used during the `attack`. A `creature` has `weapon ranks` with certain weapon categories. If a `creature` does not have the proper `weapon rank` for the weapon they are `wielding`, the weapon is instead treated as an improvised weapon. This applies to magical weapons as well as mundane ones.
