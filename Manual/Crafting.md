# Crafting

The vast majority of items are able to be crafted instead of purchased. Doing so generally nets a lower cost, but what you save in gold is made up for in time, specialized tools, and resources. In addition to these, certain items are more or less difficult to create, which further restricts who is capable of creating them. In order to make progress towards completion of an item, a `downtime action` is used in order to progress a `crafting project`.

## Recipes

Creating most items requires a recipe in order to know how to do so successfully. A recipe can be purchased, taught by someone who knows, reverse engineered from a working example, or discovered through research. The difficulty of reverse engineering the recipe is 1 higher than normal crafting, and to discover a recipe through research is 2 higher than normal crafting.

## Smithing

Creating metallic items is done with the use of the `smithing` `skill` whilst using smith tools. Weapons and armor have additional effects depending on the type of metal used, but are otherwise made in the same way.

| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Steel        | 0                 | No effect     | No effect       |

| Adamantine   | +2                | +2 damage     | +2 armor points |
| Crystine     | +3                | +4 damage     | +3 armor points |
