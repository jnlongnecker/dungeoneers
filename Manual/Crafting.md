# Crafting

The vast majority of items are able to be crafted instead of purchased. Doing so generally nets a lower cost, but what you save in gold is made up for in time, specialized tools, and resources. In addition to these, certain items are more or less difficult to create, which further restricts who is capable of creating them.
