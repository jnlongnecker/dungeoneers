# Archetypes

An `archetype` is a grouping of special, related powers. During the training of a `dungeoneer`, they may decide to specialize in an `archetype`, which grants them entry into the basic `archetypal` powers. As they practice their teachings over time, they continue to perfect these powers to unleash them in a combat scenario.

**Paladin Archetype**

-   Harvest: You gain 1 divine charge
-   Smite: While making a strike that hits, you may choose to activate this ability. When you do, the damage type becomes disintegrate and you deal 1 additional wound per divine charge you expend.
-   Aura of Life: All creatures of your choice within 2 tiles lose 1 stress per divine charge you expend.

**Bard Archetype**

-   Relieving Rhythm: Make an influence check. You relieve stress from creatures of your choice depending on the difficulty of the check
-   Terrifying Tritones: Creatures of your choice gain 1 stress on a successful test
    _`test`: [`influence`] + `finesse` vs [`examination`] + `mind`_
-   Helpful Harmony: You gain a point of stress and a number of creatures equal to your `spirit` score gain a point of `boon` on any roll on their next `turn`
-   Oscillating Octaves: Make a check: _`check`: [`music`] + `finesse`_. You spend 3 `arca` to swap places with an entity a number of tiles away equal to your roll. If the entity is a `creature`, it must allow you to do so
-   Diminishing Dissonance: A creature within a number of tiles equal to your `spirit` score gain a point of `bane` for any rolls on their next `turn` on a successful test
    _`test`: [`influence`] + `finesse` vs [`examination`] + `mind`_
