# Spells

A "spell" is a predefined, arcane formula designed to produce an effect. Dungeoneers are taught to recognize and understand spells of import to them on their job which overwhelmingly fall into categorization by element. A spell has two ways of being cast: via channeling and via incantation, both of which vary the outcome of the spell slightly. A spell has a variety of applications that more skilled arcanists can achieve with practice with the spell.
