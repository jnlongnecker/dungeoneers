# Spells

A "spell" is a predefined, arcane formula designed to produce an effect. Dungeoneers are taught to recognize and understand spells of import to them on their job which overwhelmingly fall into categorization by element. A spell has two ways of being cast: via channeling and via incantation, both of which vary the outcome of the spell slightly. A spell has a variety of applications that more skilled arcanists can achieve with practice with the spell.

## Context of Spells

Incantation is for traditional spellcaster types, while channeling is for warrior types.

Each subsequent bullet for a spell is of greater power, and will be unlocked during level-up.

Each spell will have 3 degrees of success if applicable (like other rolls) and ways to spend additional arca in order to power them up (like metamagic).

Aether is an unobtainable element except for extremely powerful beings
