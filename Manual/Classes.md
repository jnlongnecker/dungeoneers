# Classes & Abilities

A dungeoneers broad categorization is divided into one of 3 different `classes`: mage, warrior, and creator. It is common for dungeoneers to ask each other their `class`, but typically this information is obvious at a glance. A `class` simply gives an easy, surface-level glimpse at the capabilities of a dungeoneer. Their true capabilities are far more varied and nuanced, but a `class` is the highest-level and simplest breakdown of said abilities. Each `class` gives certain `abilities` to the dungeoneer when the specialize in it, and a dungeoneer may only have 1 `class`, which is picked from the moment an individual decides to become a dungeoneer.

## Mage

A mage is a dungeoneer that specializes in using magica; primarily for spells. Mages are typically further classified by the type of magica that they specialize in: demonic magica specialists are known as warlocks, holy magica specialists are known as priests, arcane magica specialists are known as sorcerers, and generalists are known as wizards. These are simply the most common categories of mage; others exist that make heavy use of magica outside of spellcraft such as bards and druids. Physically, mages often are as capable as normal humans. Where they diverge is in their wealth of magica knowledge and their ability to precisely manipulate it to aid their allies and foil their enemies.

## Warrior

A warrior is a dungeoneer that specializes in martial combat. They are not magica inept, but instead of using magica for spellcraft or channeling they instead use magica to enhance their physical capabilities. This results in warriors as superhuman beings, capable of battling `creatures` of extreme size and physical power. Warriors often specialize in specific weaponry and are classified further by the weapons they utilize. For example, warriors that specialize in ranged weaponry like bows and crossbows are called rangers, while warriors that specialize in polearms are called lancers.

### Warrior Abilities

## Creator

A creator is a dungeoneer that rather than specializing in combat, specializes in the creation of dungeoneering aids. This includes creations such as magical/nonmagical weapons and arms, potions, poisons, food acquisition, maps, jewelry, enchantments, and tomes. They use magica to enhance the speed, accuracy and quality they can produce these aids and learn new skills and information on the fly. This is not to say that they cannot fight; but they tend to be more supportive in their capabilities. The manner in which they do combat depends on the craft they are most comfortable with; for example an alchemist may fight with corrosive or explosive concoctions while a blacksmith may use their knowledge of arms and armor to create openings with their tools.

### Creator Abilities

Idea is every x levels a character gets 1 point to spend on a class ability and on the other levels they get y points for skill abilities and z points for combat abilities. Abilities will be bucketed into tiers with a level requirement
