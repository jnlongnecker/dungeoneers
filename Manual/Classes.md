# Classes & Abilities

A dungeoneers broad categorization is divided into one of 3 different `classes`: arcanist, warrior, and creator. It is common for dungeoneers to ask each other their `class`, but typically this information is obvious at a glance. A `class` simply gives an easy, surface-level glimpse at the capabilities of a dungeoneer. Their true capabilities are far more varied and nuanced, but a `class` is the highest-level and simplest breakdown of said abilities. Each `class` gives certain `abilities` to the dungeoneer when the specialize in it, and a dungeoneer may only have 1 `class`, which is picked from the moment an individual decides to become a dungeoneer.

## Arcanist

An arcanist is a dungeoneer that specializes in using arca; primarily for spells. Arcanists are typically further classified by the type of arcana that they specialize in: those that specialize in curses are often called warlocks, miracles called clerics, and incantations called incanters. Physically, arcanists often are as capable as normal humans. Where they diverge is in their wealth of arca knowledge and their ability to precisely manipulate it to aid their allies and foil their enemies.

## Warrior

A warrior is a dungeoneer that specializes in martial combat. They are not arca inept, but instead of using arca for spellcraft or channeling they instead use arca to enhance their physical capabilities. This results in warriors as superhuman beings, capable of battling `creatures` of extreme size and physical power. Warriors often specialize in specific weaponry and are classified further by the weapons they utilize. For example, warriors that specialize in ranged weaponry like bows and crossbows are called rangers, while warriors that specialize in polearms are called lancers.

## Creator

A creator is a dungeoneer that rather than specializing in combat, specializes in the creation of dungeoneering aids. This includes creations such as enchanted/unenchanted weapons and arms, potions, poisons, food acquisition, maps, jewelry, enchantments, and tomes. They use arca to enhance the speed, accuracy and quality they can produce these aids and learn new skills and information on the fly. This is not to say that they cannot fight; but they tend to be more supportive in their capabilities. The manner in which they do combat depends on the craft they are most comfortable with; for example an alchemist may fight with corrosive or explosive concoctions while a blacksmith may use their knowledge of arms and armor to create openings with their tools.

## Leveling Up

Whenever you `level up`, you gain power in accordance with your `class`. Each `class` has certain powers that they can obtain that vary slightly from one another and vary further in which tier the `level up` appears in. You'll have multiple selections that you can make, and you use 1 point to make 1 selection. A selection can only be taken as many times as there are boxes; for example an `arcanist` at level 1 can take the "gain 1 ability" selection 2 times.

In addition to selection you must spend points towards, you also gain free selections. These cost no points, you simply gain that power when you `level up`.
