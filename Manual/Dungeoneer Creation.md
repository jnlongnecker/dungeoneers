# Creating a Dungeoneer

The core of _Dungeoneers_ is to put yourself in the shoes of an elite warrior known as a dungeoneer. These individuals are trained soldiers, experienced in fighting wild `creatures` that lurk in the wilderness and in dungeons. They are talented crafters, self-sufficient hunters, and knowledgeable explorers. While a novice dungeoneers isn't at the pinnacle of their ability, they are certainly more capable than the average amateur adventurer.

In order to create a dungeoneer for yourself, the process is fairly simple:

1. Pick a `species`
2. Pick a `class`
3. Distribute `attribute scores`

## Species

The world of _Dungeoneers_ is rich with a variety of sapient `creatures` eligible to become dungeoneers. Collectively, these `species` are referred to as "humans" by the inhabitants of Adamah. When creating your dungeoneer, think of the kind of being that you'd like them to be and make your selection. The `species` section has more details about the `species` available and their `properties`.

## Classes

A `class` is a categorization of powers. It includes bonuses on `level up` as well as unique powers granted by an `archetype`. Whenever you `level up`, you'll pick a `class` to give you additional powers and `archetype` selections. When you first create your dungeoneer, picking their initial `class` will give them a curated selection of powers to customize them with. The `classes` section has more details about the available `classes` and the powers they grant.

## Attribute Scores

`Attribute scores` are the numerical representation of the basic characteristics of your dungeoneer. They consist of `body`, `mind`, `spirit`, and `finesse`. The `attribute scores` subsection in the `creatures` section has more details about `attribute scores`.

There are few ways to improve `attribute scores` once they are set. Dungeoneers are elite units and the training process is meant to raise their `attribute scores` from their commoner baseline; more training simply has diminishing returns too significant. When creating your dungeoneer, follow the below steps to set `attribute scores`:

1. Start with all `attribute scores` at 2
2. Increase 3 `attribute scores` by 1
3. Increase 3 `attribute scores` by 1
4. Increase 1 `attribute score` by 1
