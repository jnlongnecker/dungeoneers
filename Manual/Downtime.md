# Downtime

In between the pillars of combat, exploration and socialization is downtime. Downtime is not a pillar of play, but rather an abstraction of activities that happen during a passage of time outside of the 3 pillars; namely during `rests`.

## Resting

In Dungeoneers, there are several different kinds of `rest` that a Dungeoneer can partake in, all taking a varying amount of time. During a `rest`, there are no special `free actions` that are applicable, only `downtime actions`. You may take 2 `downtime actions` per `rest`, and the options that are available to you depend on your `abilities` and the kind of `rest` you participate in.
