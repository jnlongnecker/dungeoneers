# Playable Species

In Dungeoneers, you can be one of a number of different `species` of `creature`. Colloquially, this group of `creatures` is referred to as "humans". Unlike the real world (where only one "humanlike" species exists), there are many "humanlike" `species`. Each `species` is unique and offers certain `abilities` to members of that `species`, and while some `species` are better at certain roles you should pick the one you like the most!

## Ape Humans

### Mensa

In the real world, the single `species` of human left is _homo-sapiens_; mensa would be the closest equivalent to this being in Dungeoneers. Long ago, a common ancestor of mensa, gnomes, elves and dwarves split into new `species` that would eventually become the specified four. Of these relatives, the mensa is the tallest and shortest lived. Due to the shorter lifespan of mensa in comparison to many other relatives of theirs, mensa have developed a culture of conquest and ambition. The measure of a mensa is their accomplishments within society.

Mensa are the most widely spread across the surface of Adamah and are the sole `species` of their relatives to settle in the mountains. These settlements are rare; the vast majority of mensa settle near lakes and rivers across the surface. Due to this, magicians amongst mensa are more rare than with other `species`, especially gnomes and elves.

Mensa find value in many things amongst many cultures, but a common theme amongst cultures is power. In the pursuit of greater power, mensa invent new technologies; driven to better the life of their fellow mensa. The invention of technology and development of the "new" leads many mensa cultures to obsess over resource acquisition. This then leads to two strategies: conquer or trade, the choice of which greatly depends on the culture.
