# Playable Species

In Dungeoneers, you can be one of a number of different `species` of `creature`. Colloquially, this group of `creatures` is referred to as "humans". Unlike the real world (where only one "humanlike" species exists), there are many "humanlike" `species`. Each `species` is unique and offers certain `abilities` to members of that `species`, and while some `species` are better at certain roles you should pick the one you like the most!

## Ape Humans

These `species` are all descendent from an extinct ape of Adamah, the habilis.

### Mensa

In the real world, the single `species` of human left is _homo-sapiens_; mensa would be the closest equivalent to this being in Dungeoneers. Long ago, a common ancestor of mensa, elves and dwarves (habilis) split into new `species` that would eventually become the specified three. Of these relatives, the mensa is the tallest, largest and shortest lived. Due to the shorter lifespan of mensa in comparison to many other relatives of theirs, mensa have developed a culture of conquest and ambition. The measure of a mensa is their accomplishments within society.

Mensa are the most widely spread across the surface of Adamah and are the sole `species` of their relatives to settle in the mountains. These settlements are rare; the vast majority of mensa settle near lakes and rivers across the surface. Due to this, arcanists amongst mensa are more rare than with other `species`, especially gnomes and elves.

Mensa find value in many things amongst many cultures, but a common theme amongst cultures is power. In the pursuit of greater power, mensa invent new technologies; driven to better the life of their fellow mensa. The invention of technology and development of the "new" leads many mensa cultures to obsess over resource acquisition. This then leads to two strategies: conquer or trade, the choice of which greatly depends on the culture.

While dwarves and elves aren't enemies as a whole per-se, their civilizations lie quite far from one another. This lack of interaction means that their main interaction with another ape human is with mensa, and over time some have even left their civilizations for mensa ones. As mensa have integrated elves and dwarves into their own society, over time the emergence of enchantment arose from the innovation of mensa and the wealth of knowledge of elves and dwarves. Mensa integrated elven crystallography, dwarven smithing, and mensa craftsmanship to give weapons, armor and jewelry enchantments of arcane power.

#### Common Traits

-   Speech
-   Literate
-   Adish
-   Mensish
-   Medium

#### Racial Traits

##### Cultured

### Elf

The habilis offshoot that developed into what are now elves spent considerable time in and around Adaman tethers into the Faerealm, namely the fae forests. This exposure to fae arca warped this ancestor into what are now modern elves. This has distributed many properties of faeries to the elves; namely a sensitivity to arca (hyperarcanum) and an extended lifespan. Due to this longer life, elves reproduce less and gain an extended perspective on the nature of life and living with others. This reasonability and conservatism due to age is in constant competition with the chaotic nature of their environment and natural tendency, balancing out to drive elves towards progress albeit at a slower pace compared to mensa.

The culture of elves was largely established at the time of their ancestor and hasn't changed much, instead becoming interested in perfecting their hyperarcanum. Elves have a fairly strict caste system based on arcane capability and age, with the oldest, wisest and most arcane potent at the top and the youngest and arcane weakest at the bottom. It is expected that over the course of an elves life, they will advance up in caste and failure to do so by improving arcane potency is seen as the greatest failure in the life of an elf.

Arcane ability relies heavily on worldly experience and practice, so it is common to find elves as dungeoneers especially in their youth as they accrue a wealth of experience. A middle-aged elf dungeoneer is one of the most sought-after warriors due to this fact, as these elves are about as old as they get before they return home to settle down, work through research and bask in the glory of their accomplishments. The most common avenues of research are in crystallography and spellcraft, as both of these heavily reflect their hyperarcanum.

#### Common Traits

As an elf, you have the following common `traits`:

-   Ground(2)
-   Speech
-   Literate
-   Adish
-   Elivsh
-   Medium

#### Racial Traits

##### Hyperarcanum

As an elf, you have the `hyperarcanum` `trait`.

> `Hyperarcanum` is a `trait` that describes a `creature` with sensitivity towards arca. A `creature` with `hyperarcanum` has 1 extra point of `arca` than normal and regains 1 more point of `arca` from any source that would do so. However, any source that would drain `arca` will drain 1 _extra_ `arca`.

### Dwarf

Caves were an early source of habitation for the habilis, but while the ancestors to the mensa and elves left the caves, the ancestors to the dwarves went deeper. This journey into the depths resulted in heavy exposure to demonic arca. Early habilis cultivated bioluminescent plants alongside mages developing light-based arcana in order to be able to see in the depths, but over time this became less and less necessary due to demonic arca granting vision to pierce the veil of darkness. Dwarves still cultivate bioluminescent plants and animals as part of their culture, but light arcana has mostly stagnated as its use waned. This demonic arca also granted an extended lifespan to the dwarves.

Demonic arca was not without negative effects, however. The hoarding nature of demons has seeped into the culture of dwarves over time, and dwarves are now miserly and reluctant to deplete their own treasure hordes. Wise dwarven leaders are still able to make changes where necessary, but it is not uncommon for a dwarven kingdom to fall to ruin due to mismanagement.

Dwarf society revolves around mining, and their capabilities are an extension of their society of mining and exposure to arca. In order to better fit in the tight spaces of subterranean mines, dwarves evolved to be more vertically compact, strong, and gained improved sensitivity to light. Their lungs evolved a filtration membrane to be able to withstand toxic gasses commonplace in subterranean gas pockets. Dwarf culture is entirely subterranean, and over the years has moved away from the utilization of wood in favor of metal and stone work.

Dwarves have invented a material they call stricestiele, which is steel mixed with a special kind of jelly fungi called a shock mush that liquify into a sticky and viscous liquid under mechanical energy. These fungi are found in areas a short but safe distances from volcanic activity that causes common earthquakes and liquify in this way to stay attached to whatever it is they are feeding on. This fungus is exceptional at absorbing shock from repeated blows at the expense of durability from a direct hit. Any tool head that will be impacted often is therefore primarily made of steel and any handle from stricestiele.

#### Common Traits

As a dwarf, you have the following common `traits`:

-   Ground(2)
-   Speech
-   Literate
-   Adish
-   Dwarvish

#### Racial Traits

##### Toxin Resistance

As a dwarf, the membrane in your lungs grants you the `resistance(T1)` `trait`.

##### Darkvision

As a dwarf, the demonic arca pulsing through your body grants you the `darkvision` `trait`.

## Monkey Humans

Similarly to the habilis, an extinct monkey species known as the zeuxis is the ancestor to what are now the monkey-based humans: howsen, gnomes, and goblins. Their disparate environments and exposure to different kinds of arca transformed the zeuxis over many years into these extant species.
