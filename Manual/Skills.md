# Skills

A `skill` some task that a `creature's` training and experience can help them perform better. The measure of a `creature's` training in a `skill` is represented by the level of `proficiency` they have in that `skill`. A `creature's` `proficiency` is the most commonly used `die source` in all rolls in Dungeoneers. A table of the various possible levels of `proficiency` a `creature` may have and the die given by that `proficiency` can be found below:

| Proficiency | Die Given |
| ----------- | --------- |
| None        | 1d4       |
| Trained     | 1d6       |
| Experienced | 2d4       |
| Master      | 2d6       |
| Legendary   | 4d4       |
| Mythical    | 4d6       |

It may be a little confusing how the amount of dice rolled helps you practically, so to help you a bit you can find a chart of an average roll with a certain `proficiency` and `attribute score` combination.

| Proficiency | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7    | Die |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Untrained   | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8.5 | 9.5  | 1d4 |
| Trained     | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8.5 | 9.5 | 10.5 | 1d6 |
| Experienced | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12   | 2d4 |
| Master      | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14   | 2d6 |
| Legendary   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16   | 4d4 |
| Mythical    | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18   | 4d6 |

Outside of combat, you're likely to roll `checks` more often than `tests`. The difficulty of a `check` can be categorized into various tiers. These tiers of difficulty are generally only expected to be attempted by `creatures` with a certain `proficiency` level as denoted below. This doesn't mean it's always impossible for a `creature` without that `proficiency` level to succeed, but it will be much less likely.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Expected Proficiency Level |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Trivial          | 2-4    | None                       |
| Easy             | 5-7    | Trained                    |
| Moderate         | 8-9    | Experienced                |
| Hard             | 10-12  | Master                     |
| Insane           | 13-17  | Legendary                  |
| Absurd           | 18-24  | Mythical                   |
| Fantastical      | 25-29  | Mythical                   |
| Unfathomable     | 30+    | Mythical                   |

For the rest of this section, we'll go over the `skills` available in Dungeoneers, what they're used for and use our difficulty level table to give examples of some tasks that can be achieved using the `skill` and how difficult they are to accomplish.

## Combat Skills

The primary use of these `skills` is within the context of combat. While certainly not exclusive to combat contexts, they are grouped as such since that is where they are most often used.

### Striking

The `striking` `skill` is used to make contact with weaponry. If a `creature` is trying to make contact with something that is not easy to make contact with, the `striking` `skill` is used to determine how accurate they are with their weapon.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Example                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trivial          | 2-4    | Hitting a wall                                                                                                        |
| Easy             | 5-7    | Hitting an object the size of a fist in melee                                                                         |
| Moderate         | 8-9    | Shooting a bird in flight                                                                                             |
| Hard             | 10-12  | Hitting a triple bulls-eye with darts                                                                                 |
| Insane           | 13-17  | Shooting an arrow through a moving hole the size of a golf ball on a pendulum                                         |
| Absurd           | 18-24  | Shooting an arrow through an unpredictably moving hole the size of a golf ball                                        |
| Fantastical      | 25-29  | Hitting an object the size of a quarter erratically moving by tracking it through a mirror                            |
| Unfathomable     | 30+    | Shooting an arrow through a hole the size of a quarter moving erratically using the arrow's arc to hit it over a wall |

### Dodging

The `dodging` `skill` is used to avoid something from making contact; the counterpoint to `striking`. To determine if a `creature` is able to avoid damaging contact from some object, the `dodging` `skill` is used.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Example                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trivial          | 2-4    | Moving out of the way of a slow moving ball                         |
| Easy             | 5-7    | Moving out of the way of a boulder rolling down a large ramp        |
| Moderate         | 8-9    | Moving out of the way of a hidden scythe trap                       |
| Hard             | 10-12  | Moving out of the way of a hidden dart trap                         |
| Insane           | 13-17  | Avoiding multiple simultaneous traps                                |
| Absurd           | 18-24  | Avoiding multiple hidden dart traps firing at slightly offset times |
| Fantastical      | 25-29  | Avoiding multiple simultaneous traps without being able to see them |
| Unfathomable     | 30+    | Avoiding a fast-moving object capable of homing onto you            |
