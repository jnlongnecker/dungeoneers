# Skills

A `skill` some task that a `creature's` training and experience can help them perform better. The measure of a `creature's` training in a `skill` is represented by the level of `proficiency` they have in that `skill`. A `creature's` `proficiency` is the most commonly used `die source` in all rolls in Dungeoneers. A table of the various possible levels of `proficiency` a `creature` may have and the die given by that `proficiency` can be found below:

| Proficiency | Die Given |
| ----------- | --------- |
| None        | 1d4       |
| Trained     | 1d6       |
| Experienced | 2d4       |
| Master      | 2d6       |
| Legendary   | 4d4       |
| Mythical    | 4d6       |

It may be a little confusing how the amount of dice rolled helps you practically, so to help you a bit you can find a chart of an average roll with a certain `proficiency` and `attribute score` combination.

| Proficiency | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7    | Die |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Untrained   | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8.5 | 9.5  | 1d4 |
| Trained     | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8.5 | 9.5 | 10.5 | 1d6 |
| Experienced | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12   | 2d4 |
| Master      | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14   | 2d6 |
| Legendary   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16   | 4d4 |
| Mythical    | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18   | 4d6 |

> Note that these are _averages_. Your mileage my vary!

Outside of combat, you're likely to roll `checks` more often than `tests`. The difficulty of a `check` can be categorized into various tiers. These tiers of difficulty are generally only expected to be attempted by `creatures` with a certain `proficiency` level as denoted below. This doesn't mean it's always impossible for a `creature` without that `proficiency` level to succeed, but it will be much less likely.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Expected Proficiency Level |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Trivial          | 2-4    | None                       |
| Easy             | 5-7    | Trained                    |
| Moderate         | 8-9    | Experienced                |
| Hard             | 10-12  | Master                     |
| Insane           | 13-17  | Legendary                  |
| Absurd           | 18-24  | Mythical                   |
| Fantastical      | 25-29  | Mythical                   |
| Unfathomable     | 30+    | Mythical                   |

For the rest of this section, we'll go over the `skills` available in Dungeoneers, what they're used for and use our difficulty level table to give examples of some tasks that can be achieved using the `skill` and how difficult they are to accomplish.

## Combat Skills

The primary use of these `skills` is within the context of combat. While certainly not exclusive to combat contexts, they are grouped as such since that is where they are most often used.

### Striking

The `striking` `skill` is used to make contact with weaponry. If a `creature` is trying to make contact with something that is not easy to make contact with, the `striking` `skill` is used to determine how accurate they are with their weapon.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Example                                                                                                               |

### Dodging

The `dodging` `skill` is used to avoid something from making contact; the counterpoint to `striking`. To determine if a `creature` is able to avoid damaging contact from some object, the `dodging` `skill` is used.

If a `creature` does not have a `swim` `traversal speed`, they must succeed on a `swimming` `check` in order to move up to half their `ground` `traversal speed`. If they do have a `swim` `traversal speed`, they must only make `swimming` `checks` for hard difficulty level `checks` and above.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Example                                                      |

### Climbing

The `climbing` `skill` is used to traverse vertical distances without flight. If a `creature` does not have a `climb` `traversal speed`, they must succeed on a `climbing` `check` in order to move up to half their `ground` `traversal speed`. If they do have a `climb` `traversal speed`, they must only make `climbing` `checks` for hard difficulty level `checks` and above.

| Difficulty Level | Target | Example                                                                  |

## Weapon Ranks

Not every dungeoneer is equally skilled at all different kinds of weaponry. Weapon rank represents a dungeoneers level of proficiency with a specific type of weapon. The following are categories that a weapon can belong to and a dungeoneer be proficient in:

-   Axe
-   Blade
-   Cudgel
-   Lance
-   Bow
-   Tome

Weapon ranks follow a letter progression from E -> D -> C -> B -> A -> S, with E representing basic training and S representing complete mastery. Each weapon has a required rank in order to properly wield it. If a `creature` uses a weapon they do not have the weapon rank to properly wield, all `striking` rolls will have a point of `bane` and can deal a maximum of 1 wound. Access to weapon ranks is primarily tied to `class` and level.

In addition to unlocking more and more powerful weaponry by gaining weapon ranks, having a weapon rank also grants access to special `abilities` tied to that category of weaponry.
