# Skills

A `skill` some task that a `creature's` training and experience can help them perform better. The measure of a `creature's` training in a `skill` is represented by the level of `proficiency` they have in that `skill`. A `creature's` `proficiency` will bestow additional d10 dice to roll in situations where the `skill` applies. A table of the various possible levels of `proficiency` a `creature` may have and the die given by that `proficiency` can be found below:

| Proficiency | Die Given |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Untrained   | 0         |
| Trained     | 1         |
| Master      | 2         |
| Mythical    | 3         |

It may be a little confusing how the amount of dice rolled helps you practically, so to help you a bit you can find a chart of average successes with a certain `proficiency` and `target number` combination.

| Proficiency | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | Die  |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| Untrained   | 0.3 | 0.6 | 0.9 | 1.2 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 2.1 | 2.4 | 2.7 | 3d10 |
| Trained     | 0.4 | 0.8 | 1.2 | 1.6 | 2.0 | 2.4 | 2.8 | 3.2 | 3.6 | 4d10 |
| Master      | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.5 | 2.0 | 2.5 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 4.5 | 5d10 |
| Mythical    | 0.6 | 1.2 | 1.8 | 2.4 | 3.0 | 3.6 | 4.2 | 4.8 | 5.4 | 6d10 |

> Note that these are _averages_. Your mileage my vary!

The various `difficulties` of rolls can be matched up against `proficiency` levels. A `creature` with a matching `proficiency` is expected to be able to succeed on the roll, but this doesn't mean a `creature` without that `proficiency` has no chance or cannot attempt it!

| `Difficulty` | Difficulty Number (`DN`) | Expected Proficiency Level |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Trivial      | 0                        | Untrained                  |
| Easy         | 1                        | Untrained                  |
| Average      | 2                        | Trained                    |
| Hard         | 3                        | Master                     |
| Insane       | 4                        | Master                     |
| Absurd       | 5                        | Mythical                   |
| Unfathomable | 6                        | Mythical                   |

For the rest of this section, we'll go over the `skills` available in Dungeoneers, what they're used for and use our difficulty level table to give examples of some tasks that can be achieved using the `skill` and how difficult they are to accomplish.

## Combat Skills

The primary use of these `skills` is within the context of combat. While certainly not exclusive to combat contexts, they are grouped as such since that is where they are most often used.

### Striking

The `striking` `skill` is used to make contact with weaponry. If a `creature` is trying to make contact with something that is not easy to make contact with, the `striking` `skill` is used to determine how accurate they are with their weapon.

| `Difficulty`     | Example                                                                                                               |

The `music` `skill` is used to play music with instruments. Music can elicit emotions and rally the hearts and minds of `creatures`, and when laden with `arca` can significantly enhance these effects. `Proficiency` with certain instruments is not included in `music` `proficiency`, but all `creatures` are able to utilize the `music` `skill` with just their voice.

| `Difficulty`     | Example                                                                       |

| Unfathomable (6) | Improvise non-replicable music; universally moving and loved by all listeners |

## Procurement Skills

A `skill` in the procurement category is used to gather something from the world. When using these `skills`, they all take some time to complete and largely depend on what you are attempting to do and the environment you are attempting to do it in. For example, `hunting` for food in an environment with abundant game will be easier and take less time than trying to do the same in an environment with virtually no game. The GM decides how long it takes, but all the examples shown in the table are expected to take less than 1 hour.

### Hunting

The `hunting` `skill` is used to track and capture `creatures`; often for consumption or for ingredients sourced from them.
