## Social

- Ventriloquist: You can throw your voice. Pick a spot within 30 feet, you can make it sound like your voice is coming from that position. A creature can identify that the sound is coming from you with a successful test: _`test`: [`influence`] + `finesse` vs [`notice`] + `mind`_
- Mimic: You can mimic a sound you have heard, as long as you have heard it and practiced it for a total of 10 minutes. This sound can be any simple sound; a coin rolling, a creature's cry, or a person's voice. Complex, layered sounds cannot be mimicked (i.e. the layering of two sounds at once). A creature that hears your mimicked sound can determine it is fake with a successful test: _`test`: [`influence`] + `finesse` vs [`examination`] + `mind`_
