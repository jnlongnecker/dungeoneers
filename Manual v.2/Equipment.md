# Equipment

There are a variety of `items` that can be worn on your person; these `items` are called `equipment`. For a piece of `equipment` to serve proper benefit, it must be properly equipped. As a dungeoneer, you have the following `equipment slots` to wear `equipment`:

-   Head ⛑️
-   Neck 📿
-   Body 🎽
-   Back 🎒
-   Hands 🧤
-   Ring 💍
-   Ring 💍
-   Wield ✋
-   Wield ✋
-   Belt ➰
-   Feet 🥾

Every piece of `equipment` specifies which `equipment slot` it occupies and how many. If you do not have an unoccupied `equipment slot` for a piece of `equipment`, you cannot properly equip it and gain its benefits.

## Weapons

`Weapons` are tools to deal physical trauma to something. These are swords, maces, axes, hammers, spears, bows, and the like. `Weapons` are divided into categories that determine their strength, `equipment slots` and more. Use your imagination to fill out the details of your `weapon` and customize its appearance as you see fit.

| Weapon Type | Damage  | Stat           | Equipment Slots | Range | Examples                                           |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Improvised  | 1 Phys. | Power          | ✋              | 2     | a rock, a fist, a foot, a chair leg                |
| Light       | 2 Phys. | Power or Skill | ✋              | 3     | a dagger, a handaxe, a light hammer, a javelin     |
| Standard    | 3 Phys. | Power          | ✋              | 1     | a broadsword, a battleaxe, a maul, a spear         |
| Control     | 3 Phys. | Power          | ✋✋            | 2     | a zweihander, a bardiche, a polehammer, a partisan |
| Heavy       | 4 Phys. | Power          | ✋✋            | 1     | a longsword, a broadaxe, a lever mace, a glaive    |
| Missile     | 2 Phys. | Power or Skill | ✋✋            | 4     | a sling, a crossbow, a longbow                     |

## Foci

`Foci` are tools to channel arca into a lethal effect. These are crystals integrated into staffs, wands, jewelry, or just the crystal alone. `Foci` are divided into categories in a similar way as `weapons` so use your imagination to fill out the details of your `focus` and customize its appearance as you see fit.

| Focus Type        | Damage   | Stat   | Equipment Slots | Range | Examples                              |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------ | --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| Single Terminated | 1 Arcane | Arcana | ✋              | 4     | A bracelet with the crystal embedded  |
| Double Terminated | 2 Arcane | Arcana | ✋              | 3     | A wand with the crystal in the handle |
| Aggregator        | 3 Arcane | Arcana | ✋✋            | 2     | A staff floating the crystal group    |
| Geode             | 4 Arcane | Arcana | ✋✋            | 1     | An orb hosting the open geode         |

> Note: Aggregator and geode `foci` are very large. Even though there exist small versions of these in the real world (and the world of _Dungeoneers_!), these are too small to be effectively used as a `focus` of that class. It is more about the size and quantity of the crystals than the formation!

## Armor

`Armor` is clothing built to protect the wearer from harm. `Armor` is divided into categories in a similar way as `weapons`; again, use your imagination to fill out the details of your `armor` and customize its appearance as you see fit.

| Armor Type | Physical Resistance | Arcane Resistance | Equipment Slots | Examples                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Light      | 0                   | 2                 | 🎽              | studded leather armor, boiled leather armor |
| Medium     | 1                   | 1                 | 🎽              | brigandine armor, chain armor               |
| Heavy      | 2                   | 0                 | 🎽              | plate mail, heavy chain armor               |
| Shield     | 1                   | 1                 | ✋              | kite shield, round shield                   |

### Physical and Arcane Resistance

Whenever a `creature` is struck by damage, `physical resistance` or `arcane resistance` will lessen the impact. Reduce the damage by the corresponding resistance (`physical damage` is reduced by `physical resistance`, and `arcane damage` is reduced by `arcane resistance`). This leftover damage is then done to your `health`.

### Armor Die

Whenever you have `armor`, you'll additionally have an `armor die`. This is 1d6 that you roll at the end of every `downtime round`, and is utilized primarily for determining when your `armor` `breaks`.

When you take leftover damage past your `resistance`, compare that leftover damage to the total on your `armor die`. If it's greater than or equal to that total your `armor` `breaks` and must be repaired before its `physical resistance` or `arcane resistance` benefits you again.

When you have `armor` and a `shield` `equipped`, your `shield` `breaks` before your `armor` does.
