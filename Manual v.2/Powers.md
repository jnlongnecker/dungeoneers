# Powers

There are a multitude of `powers` that a dungeoneer can learn and benefit from. These are selected largely when `leveling up` and are divided into several categories:

- `Abilities`
- `Passives`
- `Exploration Techniques`

## Abilities

An `ability` is an activated `power` that costs `action points` in order to utilize. You can know any number of `abilities` that you desire, but in order to utilize an `ability` using the `abilities` `action`, it must be in your `loadout`.

Your `loadout` is the set of `abilities` that you have ready to use at any given time. At level 1, all dungoneers have a `loadout` size of 6, which can be increased through `leveling up`. During `downtime`, you are free to swap out your `loadout` as you see fit, but if you want to swap your `loadout` on the fly you must pay the `stress` penalty marked on the `ability`.

`Abilities` come in two flavors: `class abilities` and `general abilities`. Anyone can take a `general ability`, but in order for you to take a `class ability`, it must be specifically selected from the `level up` selection that grants a `class ability`. Further still, that `class ability` can only be from the `class` you have `leveled up` in.

Below is the list of `abilities`.

### General Abilities

## Passives

A `passive` is a `power` which does not need to be activated in order to apply. You can know a number of `passives` equal to your `level`.

Below is the list of `passives`.

## Exploration Techniques

An `exploration technique` is similar to an `ability` in that it needs to be activated, but `exploration techniques` are to be used in the `wilderness map`. You can know any number of `exploration techniques`, and they are activated via the `explore` `action`.

Below is the list of `exploration techniques`.
