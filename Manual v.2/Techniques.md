# Techniques

There are a multitude of `techniques` that a dungeoneer can learn and benefit from. These are selected largely when `leveling up` and are divided into 3 categories:

-   `Active Techniques`
-   `Passive Techniques`
-   `Exploration Techniques`

## Active Techniques

An `active technique` is a `technique` that must be activated as an `action` using `action points`. You can know any number of `active techniques` that you desire, but in order to activate an `active technique` as an `action`, it must be in your `loadout`.

Your `loadout` is the set of `active techniques` that you have ready to use at any given time. At level 1, all dungoneers have a `loadout` size of 6, which can be increased through `leveling up`. During `downtime`, you are free to swap out your `loadout` as you see fit, but if you want to swap your `loadout` on the fly you must pay the `stress` penalty marked on the `active technique`.

Below is the list of `active techniques`.

### General Techniques

### Warrior Techniques

#### Sweeping Strikes

⚛️ | 🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d10<br>
Tags: `Fight`

Pick a `tile` occupied by a `creature` and 2 `tiles` adjacent; all of which are in range of your `weapon`. You `fight` the `creature` in the first `tile` and the damage dealt is dealt to any `creature` occupying the other 2 `tiles`. A `creature` can be dealt damage multiple times in this way.

#### Disarm

⚛️ | 🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d10<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`

Pick a `creature` in range of your `weapon` and make a `roll`.

`skill roll` (`hit` `difficulty`)

-   Failure: You miss; nothing happens
-   Partial success (-3): You deal 1 damage, but your target holds on to their items
-   Success (0): You force your target to drop 1 item of your choice in their `wield` slots
-   Greater success (3): You force your target to drop 2 items of your choice in their `wield` slots

#### Hobble

⚛️ | 🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d6 | Duration: 1d6<br>
Tags: `Fight`

---

You `fight` a `creature` and attempt to reduce their `speed`.

`<weapon stat> roll` (`hit` `difficulty`)

-   Failure: You miss your target and they take no damage
-   Partial success (-3): Your target takes the damage from your `weapon` as `stress`
-   Success (0): Your target takes the damage from your `weapon` and their `speed` is reduced by that damage
-   Greater success (3): Your target takes double the damage from your `weapon` and their `speed` is reduced by that damage

#### Marked Shot

⚛️⚛️ | 🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d10 | Duration: 1d8<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`

---

You `mark` a `creature` within range of your `weapon`. While `marked`, whenever you deal damage to this `creature`, you deal an additional amount of `damage` equal to your `skill`.

#### Called Shot

⚛️ | 🧠🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d12<br>
Tags: `Fight`

---

You attempt to bypass the `resistances` of your target.

`skill roll` (`hit` `difficulty`)

-   Failure: You miss your target and they take no damage
-   Partial success (-3): Your target takes the damage from your `weapon` as `stress`
-   Success (0): Your target takes the damage from your `weapon` and you ignore their `resistances`
-   Greater success (3): Your target takes double the damage from your `weapon` and you ignore their `resistances`

#### Entrench

⚛️⚛️ | 🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d10 | Duration: 1d8<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`

---

You `entrench` yourself. While `entrenched`, when you `fight` you may target an additional `creature` within range, but your `speed` `stat` temporarily becomes 0. Using any `action` with the `movement` `tag` ends this `condition` early.

> Intention note: Using an `action` with the `movement` `tag` ends the `condition` before the `action` is resolved, meaning you'll be able to utilize your `speed` `stat` like normal.

#### Block

⚛️ | 🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d6 | Duration: 1d6<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`

---

You begin `blocking`. While `blocking`, you gain 1 `physical resistance`. If you have a `shield` equipped, you gain the `physical resistance` and `arcane resistance` of the `shield` instead.

> Intention note: While you have a `shield` equipped, you are already gaining the benefit of its `resistances`. This `ability` is intended to give those `resistances` _again_!

#### Elusive Strike

⚛️ | 🧠🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d12<br>
Tags: `Fight`

---

You `fight` a `creature` in range. Your `weapon` deals 1 less damage, but your target cannot counterattack.

#### Redirect

⚛️⚛️ | 🧠🧠🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d12 | Duration: 1d8<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`

---

You begin to `redirect` nearby attacks. While `redirecting`, when a `creature` attempts to `fight` another `creature` while you are in their range, you may gain 1 `stress` to force yourself to be `fought` instead.

#### Deflection

⚛️ | 🧠🧠🧠🧠<br>
Cooldown: 1d12 | Duration: 1d8<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`

---

You start `deflecting` attacks from missiles. While `deflecting`, when a `creature` attempts to `fight` you with a `missile` weapon, any dice you use to avoid their attack are not `exhausted`.

#### Rally

Cooldown: 1d10<br>
Tags: `Maneuver`
Range: Aura (5)

---

You attempt to invigorate your allies.

`skill roll` (`difficulty` 10)
