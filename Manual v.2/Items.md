# Items

`Items` are useful consumables, resources, and tools that your dungeoneers can use to help them navigate their surroundings. `Items` can be found by scavenging, bought from merchants, or crafted by hand. Unlike `equipment`, most `items` do not need to be `equipped` in order to be utilized; however there are a few that must be `equipped` in order to work. These `items` act as `improvised weapons` if you choose to `fight` with them.

## Inventory

A dungeoneer can only have a certain number of `items` on their person at any given time. This stash of goods is called their `inventory`. An `inventory` is made up of 20 slots; each of which can hold an `item` or a piece of unequipped `equipment`. If a piece of `equipment` is `equipped`, it does not take up an `inventory` slot.

Some `items` are fairly small or compact well. In these instances, an item stacks; which means that multiple can fit in the same slot. If an `item` stacks, it will be mentioned, but there are some cases of `items` coming up in-game which are not listed here. In these instances, think of whether the `item` can easily fit in the palm of your hand. If so, it probably `stacks`! The GM has final say on these edge cases.

## Components

Many `items` are made up of various smaller pieces, called `components`. When crafting `items`, the exact specifics of what kind of `component` is used often just adds to the flavor of the `item`. For `equipment`, the quality of the `component` will impact the quality of the `equipment`. Below is a list of `components` and the effect they have on `equipment`.
