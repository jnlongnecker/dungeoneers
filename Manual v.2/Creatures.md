# Creatures

There are a multitude of living beings in the world of Dungeoneers. They are collectively referred to as `creatures` and consist of anything from a common `skeleton` to the dungeoneers you play as!

## Statistics

Every `creature` has 4 `statistics` (or `stats`). They are the following:

**Power**<br>
_A `creature's` `power` refers to their physical might and impacts damage done with physical weapons_

**Speed**<br>
_A `creature's` `speed` refers to the distance they can move in a `movement` `action`_

**Arcana**<br>
_A `creature's` `arcana` refers to their ability with spells and arca and impacts damage done with arcane weapons_

**Skill**<br>
_A `creature's` `skill` refers to their talent with skilled tasks like picking locks and crafting items_

## Health and Stress

Every `creature` additionally has 2 resources; their `health` and their `stress`. Whenever a `creature` takes `damage`, the amount is subtracted from that `creature's` `health`. Once a `creature` is reduced to 0 `health`, it dies. A `creature's` `stress` is the mental damage that it can take. If a `creature's` `stress` gets maxed out, it dies.

Various `abilities` are able to recover `health` and reduce `stress`, as well as items and various things you can interact with in the dungeon.

The amount of `health` you have and `stress` you can handle is determined by your `level` and `class`.
