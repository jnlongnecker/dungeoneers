# Creatures

There are a multitude of living beings in the world of Dungeoneers. They are collectively referred to as `creatures` and consist of anything from a common `skeleton` to the dungeoneers you play as!

## Statistics

Every `creature` has 4 `statistics` (or `stats`). They are the following:

**Power**<br>
_A `creature's` `power` refers to their physical might and impacts damage done with `weapons`_

**Speed**<br>
_A `creature's` `speed` refers to the distance they can move in a `movement` `action`_

**Arcana**<br>
_A `creature's` `arcana` refers to their ability with spells and arca and impacts damage done with `foci`_

**Skill**<br>
_A `creature's` `skill` refers to their talent with skilled tasks like picking locks and crafting items_

## Health and Stress

Every `creature` additionally has 2 resources; their `health` and their `stress`. Whenever a `creature` takes `damage`, the amount is subtracted from that `creature's` `health`. Once a `creature` is reduced to 0 `health`, it becomes `incapacitated`. A `creature's` `stress` is the mental damage that it can take. If a `creature's` `stress` gets maxed out, it is reduced to 0 `health`.

Various `abilities` are able to recover `health` and reduce `stress`, as well as items and various things you can interact with in the dungeon.

The amount of `health` you have and `stress` you can handle is determined by your `level` and `class`.

### Options at 0 Health

A `creature` that isn't a dungeoneer usually just dies at 0 `health`. A dungeoneer clings to life a bit more tenaciously. Every `round` a dungeoneer is at 0 `health`, roll 1d6. On a 1, that dungeoneer dies. Alternatively, a dungeoneer can choose to take a `dive`: they avoid lethal damage at the last possible moment but truly incapacitate themselves in the process. They need a `downtime action` in order to recover any `health`, but they don't die unless they take damage.

## Arca

`Arca` is the foundational energy source of `arcana`; a metaphysical phenomenon which would be called "magic" in the real world. `Arca` is utilized to cast `spells`, `miracles`, `curses`, and other `arcana`. A dungeoneer has `arca` equal to their `level`.

## Size

A `creature` has a `size` that represents the amount of physical space that they occupy. Something to note is that not all `creatures` in the same `size` category are the exact same physical size, only that they are able to control the specified number of `tiles` with the physical space they take up.

The `size` categories, `tiles` that `creatures` of that `size` occupy and `reach` can be identified in the following table:

|                    | Tiny | Small | Medium | Large | Huge | Massive | Gargantuan |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| **Tiles Occupied** | 1/4  | 1/2   | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4       | 5+         |

Unless a `creature` occupies less than 1 `tile`, 2 `creatures` are not allowed to occupy the same `tile`. A `tile` that is fully occupied cannot be moved into or past, unless the occupying `creatures` allow it.
