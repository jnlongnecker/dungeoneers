# Downtime

`Downtime` is not a pillar of play, but rather an abstraction of activities that happen during a passage of time outside of dungeoneering. This is utilized to recover, swap out gear, and prepare for the remaining adventure.

There are several different types of `downtime`, but in each the formula is the same:

-   The `downtime` lasts a certain amount of time
-   A resource is used
-   The `dice pool` is rolled, just like at the start of a `round`
-   Each dungeoneer partaking in the `downtime` may take up to 3 `downtime actions`

Below is the list of `downtime` and the `downtime actions` you may participate in.
