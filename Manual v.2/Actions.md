# Actions

Every `player phase`, each dungeoneer has 3 `action points` to spend on `actions`. There are 5 `actions`:

- Fight
- Movement
- Interact
- Rest
- Ability

The `ability` `action` is unique in that it enables you to use one of your `abilities`, which a dungeoneer will often have multiple.

## Fight

The `fight` `action` allows you to enter combat with another `creature`. The way the `fight` `action` works depends largely on the `weapon` you have equipped.

First, you can only take the `fight` `action` on a `creature` that's in range of your `weapon`. This is distance is listed in `tiles`; if your target is within this distance then you're able to `fight` it.

Once you've started the `fight`, you'll spend your `dice pool` towards the `hit difficulty` of your opponent. For each multiple of your opponent's `difficulty`, you deal your `weapon's` damage. However, if your opponent lives once you've finished spending your `dice pool`, they will counterattack as long as you are in range of them.

You will need to spend your `dice pool` towards the `dodge difficulty` of your opponent, using your `speed` as the bonus. If you cannot meet or surpass your opponent's `dodge difficulty`, you will take the damage of their `weapon`.

## Movement

The `movement` `action` allows you to move a number of `tiles` up to your `speed`. You must spend a die in your `dice pool` in order to take this `action`. You can break this movement up over your other `actions`, but once you end your `turn` any remaining potential movement is lost.

### Movement on Difficult Terrain

Certain types of terrain is more difficult to move in than normal land. For these scenarios, a `roll` is necessary (the die used to take the `action` _can_ be used in this `roll`). Consult the chart below to determine the `difficulty` of various types of terrain:

| Terrain Type | Difficulty |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Muck/Debris  | 5          |
| Water        | 7          |
| Gap          | 10         |
| Wall         | 15         |

## Interact

The `interact` `action` allows you to manipulate an object in the environment. This varies wildly and can be anything from opening a door or chest to pulling a lever to drawing a note for yourself on the wall.

## Rest

The `rest` `action` allows you to take a breather. You may use this to do one of the following:

- Change out 1 `ability`
- Re-roll or regain 1 die for your `dice pool`
- Advance a `cooldown` by 1

## Ability

This `action` allows you to utilize one of the `abilities` in your `loadout`. You'll have to refer to the `ability` description in order to know what it will do and how many `action points` it requires.
