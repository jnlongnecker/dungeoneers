# Actions

Every `player phase`, each dungeoneer has 3 `action points` to spend on `actions`. There are 5 `actions`:

-   Fight
-   Movement
-   Rest
-   Interact
-   Ability

The `ability` `action` is unique in that it enables you to use one of your `abilities`, which a dungeoneer will often have multiple.

## Fight

The `fight` `action` allows you to enter combat with another `creature`. The way the `fight` `action` works depends largely on the `weapon` you have equipped.

First, you can only take the `fight` `action` on a `creature` that's in range of your `weapon`. This is distance is listed in `tiles`; if your target is within this distance then you're able to `fight` it.

Once you've started the `fight`, you'll spend your `dice pool` towards the `hit difficulty` of your opponent. For each multiple of your opponent's `difficulty`, you deal your `weapon's` damage. However, if your opponent lives once you've finished spending your `dice pool`, they will counterattack as long as you are in range of them.

You will need to spend your `dice pool` towards the `dodge difficulty` of your opponent, using your `speed` as the bonus. If you cannot meet or surpass your opponent's `dodge difficulty`, you will take the damage of their `weapon`.

## Movement

The `movement` `action` allows you to move a number of `tiles` up to your `speed`. You can break this movement up over your other `actions`, but once you end your `turn` any remaining potential movement is lost.

## Rest
