# Dungeoneering

The core of _Dungeoneers_ is divided into `rounds` which take two `phases`:

-   Player phase
-   World phase

During `player phase`, the first thing that occurs is a re-roll of each players' `dice pool`. They must re-roll all `exhausted` dice and may choose whether or not to re-roll their non-`exhausted` dice. The players then decide in which order to resolve each of their `turns`.

During a player `turn`, they may take up to 3 `actions`. The core 4 `actions` all use up a single `action`, but the `abilities` `action` that activates an `ability` may take more than 1 `action`. Any activation that does not require an `action` may be done so for free. The `actions` section has more information about the general `actions` available to players.

Once a player has used up all their `actions` or willingly relinquishes their `turn` before all `actions` are used, their `turn` ends. Players need not take their `turns` in the same order every `round`, nor do they need to take all their `actions` before another player can take any `actions`. However, no two players should take an `action` at the same time, and players who have just taken an `action` should be given priority to take another if they wish until they use up all their `actions`.

Once all players have taken their `turn`, the `player phase` ends and the `world phase` begins. During the `world phase`, the Game Master decides what `actions` are taken by the `environment`, other `creatures`, and any random events. Once the world has resolved, the `round` ends and a new `round` begins with the `player phase`.

## The Map

_Dungeoneers_ focuses heavily on the visual representation of the world, the map. The map has 2 levels of detail:

1. The `dungeon map`
2. The `wilderness map`

An important note on these names; they are merely titles and not always descriptive of what the maps actually represent. For example, you may have a `wilderness map` that represents a city, or a `dungeon map` that represents a forest tangle. They simply describe the level of detail they portray.

A `dungeon map` is a detailed representation of the world at the lowest (relevant) level. The `dungeon map` is divided into `tiles` that represent the space a single `medium` sized `creature` occupies. At this level, individual interactable objects are lain out as well as obstacles, hazards, and `creatures`. This is the level of detail that the majority of the game occurs in and is the level of detail referenced by all `actions` except for the `explore` `action`.

A `wilderness map` is a less detailed representation of the world that covers a larger space than a `dungeon map`. The `wilderness map` is divided into `tiles` that represent the space that can be traveled in about 30 minutes by a regular person. At this level, the minute details are not captured; instead only noting `notable features` (such as a distinct landmark like a hill or an telltale sign of a `creature`) or a `point of interest` (such as a shrine, statue, or old battle site). A `point of interest` is discovered immediately upon revealing a `wilderness map` `tile`, while a `notable feature` must be `investigated` for.

### Revealing the Map

For each level of detail, there are different ways in which more of the map is revealed. A `dungeon map` is revealed room-by-room; or by line of sight (whichever makes more sense in the moment). This means that large swathes of `tiles` are revealed all at once. A `wilderness map` is revealed tile-by-tile.

## Combat & Exploration

Fighting creatures and exploring the world are two sides of the same coin and happen together.
