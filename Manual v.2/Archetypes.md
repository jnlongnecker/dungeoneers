# Archetypes

An `archetype` is a progression of powers tied to a `class`. Whereas `techniques` are freely selectable in any order you choose, `archetypes` are skill trees of powers that often have requirements in order to select them. Whenever you `level up`, you will often gain an `archetype rank` that you can use to unlock a power from an `archetype`. You must pick an `archetype` from the `class` you have just `leveled up` in, but you may place a `rank` in any `archetype` of your choice.
