# Classes

There are 3 `classes` in Dungeoneers; each of which determine your initial powers as well as what you gain when you `level up`.

## Warrior

The `warrior` `class` is for those who wish to use their might and martial prowess in order to tackle the dungeon and all its dangers. `Warriors` are excellent at taking damage and dealing it, as well as overcoming any tests of strength.

## Arcanist

The `arcanist` `class` is for those who wish to use their wits and skill with arcana in order to overcome the dangers of the dungeon. `Arcanists` are excellent for solving a variety of tactical challenges and providing magical damage to a spread of targets.

## Technician

The `technician` `class` is for those who wish to support and empower their allies to vanquish the dungeon. `Technicians` are excellent for any skilled labor necessary and for providing key support to other dungeoneers.

## Level Up

When you `level up` in each `class`, you have a choice of a variety of powers to pick from. First, you need to pick a `class` to `level up` in. It does not need to be your starting `class` or one you have picked before. You may make 4 selections from the options presented for you in that `class`.

### Tier 1 (Level 1)

Make **4** selections from the options present. An option with multiple boxes indicate that it may be selected multiple times (once per box). Additionally, you automatically gain the options that are presented under the "Free Selections" at no cost.
